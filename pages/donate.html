        <h2 class="my-4 text-center">CRUK and PROGRESS IN CHILDHOOD CANCERS</h2>

        <p class="my-4">What role has CRUK already played in beating children’s cancers? There are many types of
          cancer that affect children, and we have made significant progress in many areas. Here are just a few examples: </p>

        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">Our pioneering research on leukaemia – the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children -
            has helped save the lives of thousands of children. Back in the 1970s our researchers figured out the molecular
            ‘signatures’ of different types of childhood leukaemia, revolutionising the way it’s treated. We have also funded
            several important clinical trials, including one showing that a new treatment called mitoxantrone could increase
            survival by more than 50 per cent for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia whose cancer has come back.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">We were involved in a trial that led to a dramatic improvement in survival for a type of
            childhood liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Now more than six out of 10 children survive hepatic tumours for 10 years
            or more, compared to around one out of 10 children in the 1970s.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">We helped to fund research that has changed the way that children are treated for Wilms’
            tumour – a type of kidney cancer. Thanks to this groundbreaking work, children are now less likely to experience the
            long-term impact of side effects including heart problems and kidney damage.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">We funded a 10 year study that has dramatically improved survival from nerve cancer neuroblastoma.
              This study found that chemotherapy given with shorter intervals between treatments increases survival rates by two thirds
              in children with high-risk neuroblastoma. What’s more, we helped develop the drugs busulphan and melphalan and helped fund
              an international trial showing they could improve survival for children with advanced neuroblastoma.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">It’s thanks to CRUK-funded scientists that the life-saving drug temozolomide was developed.
                From early pioneering lab work, to the discovery, development and first clinical trials of the drug in people with cancer,
                our researchers were involved every step of way. Licensed in 1999, this chemotherapy drug has saved many lives and continues
                to play a key role in treating certain types of brain tumours in children, including ependymomas and gliomas.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare cancer that starts in muscle tissue. Thankfully, survival rates
            for children with rhabdomyosarcoma have doubled since the early 1970s. Cancer Research UK are proud to have carried out
            the first UK clinical trials in children with rhabdomyosarcoma.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">We have opened up a Brain Tumour Centre of Excellence in Cambridge for Kids & Teens.</li>
        </ul>
