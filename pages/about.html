        <p class="my-4 text-center">Young Art Reading (YAR) is brand new art competition and exhibition for children and young people in Berkshire.
          The ‘Young Art’ concept first started in London where a volunteer-led competition and exhibition has been running annually since 1987 and
          last year raised £86,000 for Cancer Research UK. Volunteers have since replicated the competition in East Anglia, raising £120,000 for Cancer
          Research UK since their first exhibition 2003, Oxford, raising over £100,000 since 2008, and Devon and Cornwall, who held their first exhibition
          in 2018. Inspired by this success, a local volunteer committee will be launching a brand new Young Art Reading competition in Berkshire in 2019/20.</p>

        <p class="my-4 text-center">Young Art Reading is a local community fundraising event, which will bring together schools, families, local organisations
          and community groups, to showcase the creativity of Reading’s children and young people while raising money for Cancer Research UK (Registered Charity No. 089464).
          For children and young people the competition is a great way to demonstrate their creative talents, offering an exciting opportunity to have their work judged
          by experts and exhibited in public while raising money for Cancer Research’s ‘Kids and Teens’ campaign, which aims to accelerate progress, find new cures and
          kinder treatments for children’s cancers.</p>

        <p class="my-4 text-center">Each year the YAR Committee will choose a theme for the competition and work with schools across Berkshire to encourage
          children and young people (aged between 4 and 14 years) to create and submit a picture inspired by this theme. For 2019/20, the theme for the brand
          new competition will be ‘My Reading’. To participate, students donate £2 to Cancer Research UK.  Volunteers work with schools to launch the competition
          and collect students’ artwork for judging. An expert panel of judges then review the artwork, choosing entries from each participating school to exhibit
          and selecting an overall winner for each age group. The exhibition will take place in the University of Reading’s historic Great Hall, across-two days,
          with a private opening and prize presentation for families, friends, school representatives and event sponsors and opportunities for members of the public,
          schools and local community groups to view the exhibition. The exhibition raises money for Cancer Research UK in a variety of ways, including donations for:
          exhibition programmes; tote bags, postcards and canvasses of children’s artwork; and the mounted and/or framed picture (reserved for families of competition
          entrants only).</p>

            data-content="I have worked in clinical research for over 17 years predominantly in oncology. I am a cancer
            survivor and advancing science and medicine to make cancer a more manageable disease is so important to me.
            I grew up surrounded by art (my father was an architect and amateur sculptor) and believe strongly in local
            communities for which children and young people are the heart of.  I am therefore very honoured and excited
            to lead the committee, in bringing Young Art to Reading, whilst raising critical funds for Cancer Research
            UK for their vital research.">

            encourages involvement in the arts for Reading children, in aid of a cause that is very close to my heart.
            I lost my mum to breast cancer at 16 so I know how devastating this disease can be to families.">
