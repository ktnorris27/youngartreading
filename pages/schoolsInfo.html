        <p>Young Art Reading is an exciting opportunity for your pupils to have their artwork reviewed by an expert
          panel of judges and exhibited in public, while raising money for Cancer Research’s ‘Kids and Teens’ campaign,
          which aims to accelerate progress, find new cures and kinder treatments for children’s cancers.</p>

        <p>The competition will run annually from the beginning of the new academic year (2019/20). Each year the
            YAR committee will decide on a theme for the competition and work with schools to encourage children and
            young people, aged between 4 and 14 years, including those students with additional needs, to create and
            submit a picture inspired by the theme.</p>

        <p>For 2019/20, the theme will be ‘<strong>My Reading</strong>’.</p>

        <p>To participate, we ask that each student donate <strong>£2</strong> to Cancer Research UK. YAR volunteers
            will work with schools to collect pupils’ artwork for judging (January 2019). </p>

        <p>An expert panel of judges will then review the artwork, selecting entries from each participating school
           to exhibit as well as winners and runners up for each age and SEN category. Please refer to the
          <a href="#" onclick="onNavLinkClick(this); return false;" data-page="rules">Rules</a> for Young Art for more details.</p>

        <p>The YAR exhibition will take across two days, <strong>20th-21st March 2020 in the University of Reading’s Great Hall</strong>,
          with a private opening and prize presentation for families, friends, school representatives and event sponsors
          and opportunities for members of the public, schools and local community groups to view the exhibition. There
          will be an opportunity for families to purchase their child’s artwork, with all money raised going to Cancer
          Research UK’s ‘Kids and Teens’ campaign.</p>

        <p>We would be delighted if your school could provide an opportunity for your pupils to get involved in this exciting
          art competition and fundraising venture. Please confirm your interest in participating in Young Art Reading or request
